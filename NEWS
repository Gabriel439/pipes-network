# Version HEAD

* Quietly stop writing or reading bytes from a TCP socket if a
  “Broken Pipe” error happens, indicating that the remote end
  already closed the connection. Previously, a `ResourceVanished`
  exception was thrown.

* All the `*Write*D` proxies now return `()` if the remote end
  closed the connection.


# Version 0.2.0.0

* Depend on network-simple 0.2

  `serveFork` was renamed to `serve` and the previous function named
  `serve` was removed.


# Version 0.1.1.0

* Split many of the non-pipes-related TCP utilities to the own
  `network-simple` package.
* Depend on `network-simple` and re-export its functions.

# Version 0.1.0.1

* Dependency bumps.


# Version 0.1.0
